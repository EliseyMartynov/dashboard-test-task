## That was the test task for job.

What should have been implemented:

- Admin dashboard with AdminBro
- Custom dashboard with chart with data from database

To run project on local machine follow this:

```bash
npm install
npm run serve
```

But remember that you need **Postgres** being installed on your machine as well as **.env** file with connection string.
